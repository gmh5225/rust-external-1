# Rust External
A very easy-to-read base for an external Rust cheat, do realise you need your own bypassing method and you're probably better off with
an internal cheat. I wrote this over a few spare hours I had, feeling cute so I will release it (without any bypass)

## Features
- Player ESP
- TC ESP
- Aimbot (not silent)

**Does not feature a fancy gui, if thats what you're into.**
